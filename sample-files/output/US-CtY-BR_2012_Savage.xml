         <biogHist>
            <abstract>Richard Savage's life and writings were dominated by his claim to be an
                    illegitimate child of nobility. He was never recognized by his supposed birth
                    mother, the Countess of Macclesfield, Anne Gerard (later Mrs. Brett). There is
                    little dispute that she bore an illegitimate son in private rooms in Gray’s Inn
                    Lane, London. This child was baptized under the name Richard Smith on 16 January
                    1697, where he was presented as the child of John and Mary Smith. Regardless of
                    whether Savage was indeed this boy, he cultivated the image of a rejected son
                    and won the support of Samuel Johnson and other influential men of his time. He
                    was well regarded for his poetry and prose; Johnson's account of his life story
                    contributed to his fame.</abstract>

               </chronItem>
            </chronList>
            <p>The story of Richard Savage's life is a colorful one. The early years of his life
                    are uncertain, as is his true identity. He was said to be the illegitimate son
                    of Anne Gerard, Countess of Macclesfield, and Richard Savage, Earl Rivers.
                    Samuel Johnson was captivated by both the story and the man and gave him an
                    enduring legacy by writing <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">An
                        account of the life of Mr. Richard Savage</span> (1744). While Johnson wrote
                    that Savage was born in January 1698, the true son of Earl Rivers and the
                    Countess of Macclesfield was born the previous year. That child was born in
                    private rooms at Fox Court, Grays Inn Lane, Holborn, with Lady Macclesfield
                    wearing a mask throughout to avoid recognition. This birth was registered at St.
                    Andrew's Holborn, on 16 January 1697, and the boy christened Richard Smith;
                    Rivers is thought to have signed as his godfather giving the name of Captain
                    John Smith.</p>
            <p>When he was young, the illegitimate child moved among households in London: he
                    was nursed by Mary Peglear in Hampstead, then cared for by Ann Portlock in
                    Maiden Lane, Covent Garden. Savage himself claims to have been given to a poor
                    nurse, but then sheltered by a godmother, Mrs. Lloyd, who arranged to have him
                    sent to school. While Lady Macclesfield (later Mrs. Brett) insisted that both of
                    her illegitimate children had died in early childhood, Savage's claims do seem
                    to have been supported by her nephew, Lord Tyrconnel, and Rivers's daughter,
                    Bessy Savage, Countess of Rochford.</p>
            <p>What we do know is that the man known as Richard Savage presented himself as Earl
                    Rivers's son when he was charged with possessing seditious material in the wake
                    of the Jacobite uprising in 1715. From that point, he was increasingly vocal
                    about his origins and won the support of many within London's literary and
                    theatrical circles. Accounts of his fantastic life were published by Giles Jacob
                    (1719), Eliza Haywood (1724), and Aaron Hill (1724). Charles Beckingham was the
                    reputed author of a 1727 work that detailed Savage's brush with the gallows:
                        <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">The life of Mr. Richard
                        Savage, : who was condemn'd wih Mr. James Gregory, the last sessions at Old
                        Baily, for the murder of Mr. James Sinclair, at Robinson's coffee-house at
                        Charing-Cross</span>. Meanwhile, Savage indulged in autobiography in his
                        <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic"> Miscellaneous Poems and
                        Translations</span> (1726) and his successful confessional work, <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">The Bastard</span> (1728). Among
                    the more influential works to perpetuate Savage's story was Samuel Johnson's
                    anonymously published work of 1744, <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">An account of the life of Mr. Richard
                        Savage</span>. Savage’s final work was a poem that was published
                    posthumously. <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">London and
                        Bristol Delineated</span> attacked the community he had found in
                    Bristol.</p>
            <p>Although Savage may be known best for his colorful if unsubstantiated background,
                    he is also known to have written political pamphlets as well as stinging
                    personal satire. Prior to the Jacobite uprising of 1715, he wrote two pamphlets:
                        <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">An Ironical Panegyrick on
                        his Pretended Majesty G---</span> and <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">The Pretender</span>. Later, he published <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">The Convocation, or, A Battle of
                        the Pamphlets</span>. , followed by the satirical <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">Authors of the Town</span> (1725). In 1727, he
                    returned to politics in <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">A
                        Poem, Sacred to the Glorious Memory of ... King George</span>, which
                    represents a failed bid for patronage. In 1732, he wrote <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">Religion and Liberty: an Epistle to ... Sir Robert
                        Walpole</span>, followed by the anti-clerical <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">The Progress of the Divine</span> in 1735, which
                    may have led to his being charged with obscenity. Again hoping for patronage, he
                    published <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">On the Birth-Day of
                        the Prince of Wales</span> (1736), <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">A Poet's Dependence on a Statesman</span> (1736),
                    and, finally, <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">Of Public Spirit
                        in Regard to Public Works</span> (1737).</p>
            <p>In addition to his work as a provocateur, Savage was respected within literary
                    and theatrical circles. He was asked to adapt for the stage Mrs. Lucy Rodd
                    Price's translation of Calderón's <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">La dama duende</span>, though he did not see the
                    production through. He did, however, revise and produce <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">Woman is a Riddle</span> in December 1716. In
                    1718, he produced <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">Love in a
                        Veil</span>, which may have been another of Mrs. Price's translations of
                    Calderón. In 1723 he wrote, produced, and appeared in the tragedy <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">Sir Thomas Overbury</span>. At
                    the time he was living at the home of Lord Tyrconnel, he wrote what he
                    considered to be his best work: <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">The Wanderer: A Vision</span> (1729) as well as
                        <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">The Triumph of Health and
                        Mirth</span> (1730), which he dedicated to the recovery of Lady Tyrconnel.
                    Also in that period, he was said to have provided information for Alexander
                    Pope's <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">Dunciad</span> (1728)
                    and <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">The Dunciad
                        Variorum</span> (1729). In 1729 he used the pseudonym Iscariot Hackney when
                    satirizing his literary contemporaries in <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">An Author to be Lett</span>.</p>
            <p>Savage never married, though he is reputed to be the father of Eliza Hayward's
                    first child and was proposed as a husband for Richard Steele's illegitimate
                    daughter. Savage's end is in keeping with his precarious existence. Alexander
                    Pope had established a fund so that Savage could retire in Swansea. He remained
                    there for less than two years; when he stopped in Bristol on his way back to
                    London, he was imprisoned for a debt of £8. After suffering pain in his back and
                    side, he died in Bristol Newgate prison on 1 August 1743. He was buried in the
                    churchyard of St. Peter's, Bristol, England, at the expense of his jailor, Abel
                    Dagge.</p>
