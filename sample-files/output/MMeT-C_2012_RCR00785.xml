            <abstract>Political Research Associates was founded in 1981 by Jean Hardisty and Chip
          Berlet. Originally known as Midwest Research and based in Chicago, the group moved to
          Boston in 1987 and changed its name to Political Research Associates. </abstract>
            <p>In 1981, Political Research Associates began exposing the broad spectrum of Rightwing
          violence through the in-depth analysis of founding director Jean Hardisty and Chip Berlet.
          Originally known as Midwest Research and based in Chicago, it quickly became known for its
          work on behalf of racial justice. In 1987, Citizens Alert recognized the think tank with
          its "Rev. Willie Baker Award” for “outstanding efforts” working for racial justice in
          Chicago by helping anti-racist activists understand how White supremacist and antisemitic
          groups mobilized support in neighborhoods. By 1987, the organization had moved to Boston,
          changed its name to Political Research Associates, and expanded the range of the US Right
          that it analyzed. In 1991, PRA launched a collaboration with South End Press with the
          publication of two books by Russ Bellant: The Coors Connection: How Coors Family
          Philanthropy Undermines Democratic Pluralism, and Old Nazis, the New Right, and the
          Republican Party. The next year, it began publication of its magazine The Public Eye to
          present the latest research on the US Right for use by advocates and journalists, while
          continuing to issue special reports. In its long history, PRA has provided, readable
          research on Posse Comitatus, the militia movement, neo-Nazis, the Christian Right,
          conservative think tanks, anti-immigrant movements, and government repression. </p>
