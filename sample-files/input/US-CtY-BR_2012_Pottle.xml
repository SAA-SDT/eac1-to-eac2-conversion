                <abstract>Frederick Pottle was born in Center Lovell, Maine, on 3 August 1897. He
                    graduated from Colby College in 1917, after which he taught for a time at Hebron
                    Academy and served as an orderly in the Army in World War I. After the war, he
                    undertook graduate studies at Yale, which is where he began the work on James
                    Boswell for which he is best known. He taught English at Yale from 1925 until
                    his retirement; during much of this time, he worked with his wife, Marion (née
                    Starbird), on the Boswell papers. They began in 1930 at the home of collector
                    Ralph Heyward Isham and continued when Yale bought the papers in 1949; Marion
                    Pottle arranged and catalogued the Boswell collection, while Frederick Pottle
                    served as editor. He remained as editor until he retired due to ill health; he
                    died in New Haven, Connecticut, on 16 May 1987.</abstract>

                <p>Frederick A. Pottle was born in Center Lovell, Maine to Leroy and Annette Kemp
                    Pottle. He studied at Colby College and Yale University and is best known for
                    editing the private papers of James Boswell. He published several volumes, most
                    of which pertained to Boswell; among those were <span localType="title"
                        style="font-style:italic">Boswell’s London Journal: 1762-1763</span> (1950)
                    and <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">James Boswell: The Early
                        Years, 1740-1769</span> (1966).</p>
                <p> Pottle spent his early life in Maine. He attended Colby College and received his
                    B.A. in 1917. Afterwards, he taught at Hebron Academy. From 1917-1919, he served
                    as a medical corpsman with the Army at Evacuation Hospital No. 8 in Mayen,
                    Germany; he wrote about his experiences in <span localType="title"
                        style="font-style:italic">Stretchers; The Story of a Hospital Unit on the
                        Western Front</span>. After the war, he began graduate studies in English at
                    Yale. After completing his M.A. in 1921, he taught for two years at the
                    University of New Hampshire. He returned to Yale to complete his doctorate
                    beginning in 1923, and thus initiated an association with James Boswell that
                    would endure for the rest of his life.</p>
                <p>When Pottle began his doctoral studies, Chauncey Brewster Tinker encouraged him
                    to do a bibliographic analysis of Boswell’s papers. He completed his doctorate
                    in 1925, at which time be began teaching at Yale. The book based upon his
                    dissertation, <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic">The Literary
                        Career of James Boswell</span>, was published in 1929; in 1930, Pottle
                    became the youngest man appointed to the position of full professor in the
                    University’s English Department. Although he is best known for his work on
                    Boswell, Pottle had other literary interests as well. He wrote on <span
                        localType="title" style="font-style:italic">The Idiom of Poetry</span>
                    (1963) as well as a work on <span localType="title" style="font-style:italic"
                        >Shelley and Browning: A Myth and Some Facts</span> (1965).</p>
                <p>In the same year that he became a full professor, Ralph Heyward Isham asked
                    Pottle to spend time at his house in Glen Cove, New York, editing the James
                    Boswell papers that he had collected. Pottle adopted a schedule wherein he
                    taught at Yale three days a week and commuted to Glen Cove to work on the papers
                    for another three days. When he was able to take research leave, he and his
                    wife, Marion, worked full time on the papers. After some time in Glen Cove,
                    Pottle returned to teaching full time at Yale, and in the ensuing decade assumed
                    administrative positions including Head of the English Department and Director
                    of Graduate Studies. In 1944, he was named Sterling Professor of English, a
                    position he held until his retirement from academic teaching in 1966.</p>
                <p>When Ralph Isham sold his collection of Boswell papers to Yale in 1949, Pottle
                    was appointed editor-in-chief of the Yale Editions of the Private Papers of
                    James Boswell; he remained in that position until he retired in 1979. During his
                    tenure as Editor, more than ten volumes of edited journals were published, in
                    addition to scholarly works based on Boswell’s writings.</p>
                <p>Frederick Pottle was joined in his work by his wife, Marion, who was listed as a
                    co-author on some of the catalogues. Together they had three children. Their
                    daughter, Annette, was born and died in 1921; their youngest son, Samuel
                    (1934-1978) also predeceased them; they were survived by their elder son,
                    Christopher (1932-2011). Frederick Pottle died at the New Haven Convalescent
                    Home on 16 May 1987; his wife died on 24 May 1992.</p>
